# File I/O

The `FileIO` module provides basic file I/O operations.
Right now, these are limited to reading bytes from a file, and writing bytes to a file.
The API is intentionally limited in scope and will be expanded later.

The `examples/FileIO` directory contains more detailed examples of how to use the `FileIO` module.
